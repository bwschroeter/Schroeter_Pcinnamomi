Figure_: Predicted secreted Phytophthora cinnamomi proteins. Total proteins obtained from .faa file were ran through multiple predictive models: SignalP, predicted signal peptides containing a Sec/SPI SPs using signalP6.0. Phobius, TMHMM and Pfam contain a predicted; signal peptides (Phobius-1.01); fewer than one transmembrane helix and a signal peptide within the first 60 amino acids (TMHMM-2.0C); or a Pfam domain associated with plant pathogenesis (Pfam-35.0), respectively using InterProScan 5.62-94. CAZyme are predicted carbohydrate-active enzymes using dbCAN3. Genome contains previously predicted known effectors (RxLR, CRN and NLPs) from Engelbrecht, Juanita, et al. 2021.

Figure_: Detected predicted secreted Phytophthora cinnamomi genes expression at 18-, 30-, and 48 hours post inoculation (hpi) in lupin. Genes were considered up regulated if log2fold change was greater than 0 and padj < 0.05, while down regulated if log2fold change was less than 0 and padj < 0.05.

Figure_: Over representative analysis (ORA) of predicted apoplastic effectors (red), cytosolic effectors (blue) predicted using EffectorP-3.0, together with secreted genes (black) up regulated at 18-, 30-, and 48 hours post inoculation (hpi) in lupin. Background genes are all genes detected throughout the time course.

Figure_: Secreted Phytophthora cinnamomi genes expressed in Lupin at 18 hours post inoculation (hpi). Predicted effectors (red), predicted secreted genes (blue) and non significant secreted genes (black). Significance is denoted by +/- log2foldchange in expression compared to vegetative hyphae grown on agar and padj > 0.5.

Figure_: Secreted Phytophthora cinnamomi genes expressed in Lupin at 30 hours post inoculation (hpi). Predicted effectors (red), predicted secreted genes (blue) and non significant secreted genes (black). Significance is denoted by +/- log2foldchange in expression compared to vegetative hyphae grown on agar and padj > 0.5.
